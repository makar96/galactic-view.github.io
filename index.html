       <p class="p1">For thousands of years, man has admired the immense beauty of the night sky, plunging deeper and deeper into reflections on the nature of the universe, its origin, its limits and his destiny in this world. Cosmic phenomena transformed into a cult, religion, and customs. The stars were given mystical and almost divine characteristics. In all corners of the Earth, in all nations, space is firmly rooted in culture, becoming a pillar for exploring the world around (in the most global sense of the word)</p>
       <p class="p1">I've loved cosmology since a very long time ago. Even when I was very young, I was sent to a village, the sky above which was not blinded by the lights of big cities, and it seemed so low that it was about to fall to the ground. That's where the huge night sky made such a stunning impression on me. It became even more interesting when encyclopedias began to appear in my hands, from which I learned about the solar system, planets, stars, dark matter, black holes, white dwarfs, and the speed of light…The pages drifted away one by one, and there were fewer questions, but with each page I read, the universe in my mind grew larger. </p>
       <p class="p1">Many years have passed, but such deep feelings for space have not cooled down one iota. Although in the turmoil of everyday life and the waterfall of events, I began to devote less time to exploring the vast ocean of the universe, but randomly coming across articles excite my imagination as in my childhood. </p>
       <p class="p1">As part of learning programming languages, I decided to write my first website (or at least try it), but, of course, a question arose regarding its topic.  And the first thought was space. There was no doubt, I realized that I wanted to create a website that would contain some of the basics of cosmology and astrophysics and that could be used by schoolchildren and students for their work.</p>
        <p class="p1">Dear readers and casual visitors of the site, I am glad that you are here. I hope you will find something interesting, and maybe even useful. Have fun reading!</p>

    <h2 class="h2-center" id="selection1">Events that are not so far away as fast</h2>
    <p class="p1">Looking at the night sky creates a strong impression of an unchanging universe. Yes, clouds float across the moon, the sky revolves around the North Star, and over longer periods, the Moon itself grows and wanes, and the Moon and planets move against the background of the stars. But we know that these are just local phenomena caused by movement within our Solar system. Outside the planets, the stars appear to be stationary.</p>
    <p class="p1">Of course, stars move at speeds of up to several hundred kilometers per second, so a fast star can travel about ten thousand million kilometers in a year. This is a thousand times less than the distance to even the nearest stars, so their apparent position in the sky changes very slowly. (For example, a relatively fast star known as Barnard's star is about 56 million million kilometers away.; it moves along the line of sight at a speed of about 89 kilometers per second, or 2.8 thousand million kilometers per year, and as a result, its apparent position shifts by an angle of 0.0029 degrees per year.) Astronomers refer to the shift in the apparent position of the nearest stars in the sky as "proper motion." The apparent position of the more distant stars in the sky changes so slowly that their own movement cannot be noticed even with the most patient observation.</p>
    <img src="движение звезд.gif" loading="lazy">
    <p class="p1">Modern cosmology dates back to the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1915-1917, American astronomer Vesto Slipher discovered that galaxies (which were then called nebulae) do not stand still, but move through space, and most of them are moving away from us. This conclusion followed from observations of the spectra of galaxies: their motion manifested itself in a shift of spectral lines to the red end of the spectrum.</p>
    <p class="p1">This kind of redshift, which can be interpreted as the Doppler effect, which has long been known in physics, has, as it later turned out, a universal character: it is observed in all galaxies in the universe. The only exceptions are the star systems closest to us, for example, the famous Andromeda nebula and other (smaller) galaxies located at distances not exceeding about 1 megaparsec (1 Mpc ≈ 3.26 million light-years). If the distances are greater than 1 Mpc, then the galaxies, in Slipher's words, "scatter in space."</p>
    <img class="the Doppler effect" src="the Doppler effect.gif"   width="100" height="auto" loading="lazy">
    <p class="p1">In 1929, another American researcher, Edwin Hubble, who is often called the greatest astronomer of the twentieth century, determined that the motion of fleeing galaxies follows a simple law: the speed V of the galaxy moving away from us is proportional to the distance R to it: V = H R. This relationship between speed and distance is now called Hubble's law, and the proportionality coefficient H is the Hubble constant. The value of H is constant in the sense that it is the same for all galaxies and does not depend either on the distance to the galaxy or on the direction to it in the sky.</p>
    <p class="p1">The discoveries of Slipher and Hubble, as well as further research, laid the observational foundation on which all modern cosmology is being built and developed. We now know that we live in a vast world that is also expanding over time. The expansion began about 14 billion years ago; this gigantic period of time is considered the age of the world. And the event that gave rise to the cosmological expansion is called the Big Bang.</p>
    <img src="Эдвин Хаббл.jpeg" loading="lazy">
    <figcaption>Edwin Hubble</figcaption>
    <p class="p1">But what is the physical nature of the Big Bang? Where did the galaxies get their huge escape velocities? What caused them to rapidly move away from each other? Neither the famous observational astronomers, the founders of cosmology, nor the great physicists, starting with Einstein, could answer these questions. The cosmologists of our day have no answer to them either. Perhaps this is the most difficult and most intractable mystery that has ever arisen in the natural sciences. We do not know where the cosmological expansion actually began, and we have no idea about the physics that could be behind it. It is not even known how to solve the problem of the cause of cosmological expansion. Moreover, nothing can be said about what happened before this event, and it is not even clear what "before" means here.</p>
     <img src="big bang metric.jpg" loading="lazy">
    <p class="p1">Nevertheless, the very possibility of world expansion was predicted by the Russian mathematician Alexander Friedman, a classic of world science. Using Einstein's theory, Friedman developed in 1922-1924 a physico-mathematical model of the world, which is in a state of general expansion. A direct consequence of this model is the law of proportionality of velocity and distance, which was discovered in the Hubble observations. Friedman's cosmological model is the theoretical basis of modern cosmology. This model, combined with astronomical observations, describes the dynamics of cosmological expansion very well. Of course, not from the "beginning", about which nothing is known. But it's remarkable that Friedman's theory holds true immediately after the first second of cosmological expansion. Apart from this first second, the entire subsequent history of the world is known to us; moreover, this theory also speaks about the future of the universe: it predicts that cosmological expansion will continue indefinitely.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-center" id="selection1">Let's delve into the history…</h2>
        <p class="p1">Although cosmology is a very young science, since ancient times the night sky has been an object of people's interest. At first, they observed visible constellations and planets, then, driven by scientific interest, they began to invent all kinds of devices with which it was possible to see much more.</p>
        <p class="p1">Already in Ancient Greece in the 4th century BC, the scientist Heraclides of Pontus suggested the rotation of the Earth around its axis, based on his observations, concluded that Mercury and Venus revolve around the Sun and was the first to talk about the astronomical year, as the period of rotation of our planet around the Sun. However, for a long time it was believed that the Earth is located in the center of the Solar system and the Sun revolves around it. A similar model of the Solar system was proposed by the Late Hellenistic scientist Claudius Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria in the 2nd century AD.</p>
        <img src="Гераклит Понтийский.jpeg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Heraclides Ponticus</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">It was only in the 16th century that Nicolaus Copernicus refuted the geocentric concept of the Solar System that had existed for centuries and proved in his treatise "On the Rotation of the Celestial Spheres" that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Since his conclusions contradicted the official position of the church, the Polish scientist had been preparing the scientific community for such an important discovery for a long time, which truly revolutionized the whole world. Copernicus' work was published in Germany 40 years after his research began, shortly before his death in 1543. In the 17th century, the teachings of Copernicus were declared heresy and his followers were persecuted.</p>
        <img src="Николай Коперник1.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Nicolaus Copernicus</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">Almost simultaneously with Copernicus, the Dominican monk Giordano Bruno developed his revolutionary ideas, who in 1584 published the work "On the Infinity of the Universe and Worlds," in which, referring to the teachings of Copernicus, he spoke about the infinity of the Universe, that it consists of different worlds. Bruno also argued that the stars visible in the sky are similar to the Sun, just much further away. Because of his bold statements contradicting the opinions of English scientists and theologians, Bruno fled England, fearing for his life, but this did not help him – he was arrested by the Inquisition, sent to prison and 7 years later publicly burned at the stake in Rome as a heretic.</p>
        <img src="Джордано Бруно.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Giordano Brunos</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">Copernicus' ideas about the heliocentric structure of the Solar system were also developed by another Italian mathematician and astronomer, Galileo Galilei. Galileo himself created an optical telescope that allowed him to achieve 32x magnification, which made it possible for him to detect the relief on the surface of the Moon, spots on the surface of the Sun, and also establish that the Sun and all other celestial bodies, like our planet, rotate around their axis.</p>
        <img src="Galileo-Galilei.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Galileo Galilei</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">The 16th century was indeed a turning point – after the spread of Copernicus' works, prominent scientists appeared in different countries whose views on the structure of the universe were far from universally accepted. One of them was the German researcher Johannes Kepler, who for the first time recorded a supernova outbreak in the night sky, and also developed mathematical laws of motion of the planets of the Solar system – he managed to establish a direct relationship between the distance of the planet from the Sun and the speed of its rotation.</p>
        <p class="p1">Kepler's main work is the scientific treatise "Rudolph tables" — astronomical tables of the motion of celestial bodies, which have found wide practical application among astronomers and sailors in the navigation of ships.</p>
        <img src="Иоганн Кеплер.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Johannes Kepler</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">Subsequently, the world-famous English scientist Isaac Newton, the creator of the theory of universal gravitation and celestial mechanics, relied on Kepler's works. It was he who quite clearly formulated the idea of the unity of the universe as a strict system with interdependent elements subject to uniform laws. Newton created a mirror telescope in 1668, which made it possible to achieve a better image of the studied objects.</p>
        <img src="Исаак Ньютон.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Isaac Newton</figcaption>
        <p class="p1">In general, it was through the efforts of all the above-mentioned scientists that the foundations of the study of the universe were laid. Their discoveries took place in a continuous struggle against generally accepted views, as well as in conditions of poor technical equipment, which, nevertheless, did not prevent them from making important discoveries that allowed subsequent generations to explore new outer spaces.</p>
        <p class="p1">At the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries, the most important breakthrough in the field of astronomy was made – the discovery of our Galaxy. This time, the Englishman William Herschel distinguished himself again, who opened the boundaries of our Galaxy with the help of a 12-meter telescope of his own design.</p>
        <p class="p1">Astronomical science developed as follows: it was proved that the Earth is not the center of the Solar system, then there was evidence that the Solar system is not the center of the Galaxy, and the Galaxy itself is one of the many existing Galaxies. Along with this understanding, the concept of deep space and interest in it were born.</p>
    <h3 id="What is outer space?">What is outer space?</h3>
    <p class="p1">
        From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is everything that lies outside the boundary separating the Earth from space. There are different definitions of where exactly outer space begins. The most widely used boundary is Karman’s line, which sits 100 km above mean sea level. Starting from this mark, the air becomes too thin for regular aircraft (relying on lift) to fly.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Outer space structure">Outer space structure</h3>
    <p class="p1">
        Outer space can be divided into several regions. They are determined by magnetic fields and “winds” that dominate within them.

Geospace is the region of outer space near the Earth. It lies between the Earth’s upper atmosphere and the outermost reaches of the Earth’s magnetic field.
Interplanetary space is the outer space within the Solar System. It is defined by the solar wind, which forms a heliosphere – a giant “bubble” around the Sun and its planets. At heliopause (the outer edge of the heliosphere), it passes over into interstellar space.
Interstellar space is the physical space between the star systems in a galaxy. It is filled with the interstellar medium (ISM), which consists of gas and dust.
Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. It is very close to a total vacuum, as it’s generally free of dust and debris.

    <img src="космос2.jpg" loading="lazy">
        <p class="p1">
            Scientists think the universe consists of three types of substances: normal matter, dark matter, and dark energy
        </p>
    <h3 id="Normal matter">Normal matter</h3>
    <p class="p1">Normal matter, also called ordinary or baryonic, consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up every visible object around. Everything that we can see – stars, planets, trees, animals, and human beings – is made of normal matter. The proportion of normal matter in the universe is surprisingly small – less than 5%</p>
    <h3 id="Dark matter">Dark matter</h3>
    <p class="p1">Dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light and energy and thus is completely invisible. Scientists assume it is composed of non-baryonic matter, such as WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), neutralino, and neutrino. Though dark matter can’t be observed directly, astronomers assume it exists because of its gravitational effect on normal matter. For instance, the examination of spiral galaxies has shown that they contain more mass than could be seen. Without dark matter, the galaxies would just fly apart, for the gravitational force of the normal matter alone is not enough to pull together all the particles. Dark matter supposedly makes up about 27% of the universe.</p>
    <h3 id="Dark energy">Dark energy</h3>
    <p class="p1">Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that repels gravity: it pulls cosmic objects apart while gravity draws them close together. The concept of dark energy has been proposed by scientists to explain why the universe is not just expanding but is doing so at an increasing rate. For now, scientists have not defined its nature and origin: here, “dark” rather means “unknown” than literally dark, as is the case with dark matter. Dark energy is estimated to account for roughly 68% of the universe.</p>
